# Pagerank Project

In this project, you will create a simple search engine for the website <https://www.lawfareblog.com>.
This website provides legal analysis on US national security issues.

**Due date:** Sunday, 18 September at midnight

**Computation:**
This project has low computational requirements.
You are not required to complete it on the lambda server (although you are welcome to if you'd like).

## Background

**Data:**

The `data` folder contains two files that store example "web graphs".
The file `small.csv.gz` contains the example graph from the *Deeper Inside Pagerank* paper.
This is a small graph, so we can manually inspect the contents of this file with the following command:
```
$ zcat data/small.csv.gz
source,target
1,2
1,3
3,1
3,2
3,5
4,5
4,6
5,6
5,4
6,4
```

> **Recall:**
> The `cat` terminal command outputs the contents of a file to stdout, and the `zcat` command first decompressed a gzipped file and then outputs the decompressed contents.

As you can see, the graph is stored as a CSV file.
The first line is a header,
and each subsequent line stores a single edge in the graph.
The first column contains the source node of the edge and the second column the target node.
The file is assumed to be sorted alphabetically.

The second data file `lawfareblog.csv.gz` contains the link structure for the lawfare blog.
Let's take a look at the first 10 of these lines:
```
$ zcat data/lawfareblog.csv.gz | head
source,target
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/topic/interrogation
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/upcoming-events
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/our-comments-policy
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/litigation-documents-related-appointment-matthew-whitaker-acting-attorney-general
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/topic/lawfare-research-paper-series
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/topic/book-reviews
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/documents-related-mueller-investigation
www.lawfareblog.com/,www.lawfareblog.com/topic/international-law-loac
```
You can see that in this file, the node names are URLs.
Semantically, each line corresponds to an HTML `<a>` tag that is contained in the source webpage and links to the target webpage.

We can use the following command to count the total number of links in the file:
```
$ zcat data/lawfareblog.csv.gz | wc -l
1610789
```
Since every link corresponds to a non-zero entry in the `P` matrix,
this is also the value of `nnz(P)`.
(Technically, we should subtract 1 from this value since the `wc -l` command also counts the header line, not just the data lines.)

To get the dimensions of `P`, we need to count the total number of nodes in the graph.
The following command achieves this by: decompressing the file, extracting the first column, removing all duplicate lines, then counting the results.
```
$ zcat data/lawfareblog.csv.gz | cut -f1 -d, | uniq | wc -l
25761
```
This matrix is large enough that computing matrix products for dense matrices takes several minutes on a single CPU.
Fortunately, however, the matrix is very sparse.
The following python code computes the fraction of entries in the matrix with non-zero values:
```
>>> 1610788 / (25760**2)
0.0024274297384360172
```
Thus, by using sparse matrix operations, we will be able to speed up the code significantly.

**Code:**

The `pagerank.py` file contains code for loading the graph CSV files and searching through their nodes for key phrases.
For example, you can perform a search for all nodes (i.e. urls) that mention the string `corona` with the following command:
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --search_query=corona
```

> **NOTE:**
> It will take about 10 seconds to load and parse the data files.
> All the other computation happens essentially instantly.

Currently, the pagerank of the nodes is not currently being calculated correctly, and so the webpages are returned in an arbitrary order.
Your task in this assignment will be to fix these calculations in order to have the most important results (i.e. highest pagerank results) returned first.

## Task 1: the power method

Implement the `WebGraph.power_method` function in `pagerank.py` for computing the pagerank vector by fixing the `FIXME` annotation.

**Part 1:**

To check that your implementation is working,
you should run the program on the `data/small.csv.gz` graph.
For my implementation, I get the following output.
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/small.csv.gz --verbose

```
Yours likely won't be identical (due to weird floating point issues), but it should be similar.
In particular, the ranking of the nodes/urls should be the same order.

> **NOTE:**
> The `--verbose` flag causes all of the lines beginning with `DEBUG` to be printed.
> By default, only lines beginning with `INFO` are printed.

**Part 2:**

The `pagerank.py` file has an option `--search_query`, which takes a string as a parameter.
If this argument is used, then the program returns all nodes that match the query string sorted according to their pagerank.
Essentially, this gives us the most important pages related to our query.

Again, you may not get the exact same results as me,
but you should get similar results to the examples I've shown below.
Verify that you do in fact get similar results.

```

**Part 3:**

The webgraph of lawfareblog.com (i.e. the `P` matrix) naturally contains a lot of structure.
For example, essentially all pages on the domain have links to the root page <https://lawfareblog.com/> and other "non-article" pages like <https://www.lawfareblog.com/topics> and <https://www.lawfareblog.com/subscribe-lawfare>.
These pages therefore have a large pagerank.
We can get a list of the pages with the largest pagerank by running

```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz
INFO:root:rank=0 pagerank=2.8741e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-job-board
INFO:root:rank=1 pagerank=2.8741e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/masthead

INFO:root:rank=9 pagerank=2.8741e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/our-comments-policy
```

Most of these pages are not very interesting, however, because they are not articles,
and usually when we are performing a web search, we only want articles.

This raises the question: How can we find the most important articles filtering out the non-article pages?
The answer is to modify the `P` matrix by removing all links to non-article pages.

This raises another question: How do we know if a link is a non-article page?
Unfortunately, this is a hard question to answer with 100% accuracy,
but there are many methods that get us most of the way there.
One easy to implement method is to compute what's called the "in-link ratio" of each node (i.e. the total number of edges with the node as a target divided by the total number of nodes),
and then remove nodes from the search results with too-high of a ratio.
The intuition is that non-article pages often appear in the menu of a webpage, and so have links from almost all of the other webpages;
but article-webpages are unlikely to appear on a menu and so will only have a small number of links from other webpages.
The `--filter_ratio` parameter causes the code to remove all pages that have an in-link ratio larger than the provided value.

Using this option, we can estimate the most important articles on the domain with the following command:
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --filter_ratio=0.2
INFO:root:rank=0 pagerank=3.4696e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/trump-asks-supreme-court-stay-congressional-subpeona-tax-returns

INFO:root:rank=9 pagerank=1.4240e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-bonus-edition-gordon-sondland-vs-committee-no-bull
```
Notice that the urls in this list look much more like articles than the urls in the previous list.

When Google calculates their `P` matrix for the web,
they use a similar (but much more complicated) process to modify the `P` matrix in order to reduce spam results.
The exact formula they use is a jealously guarded secret that they update continuously.

In the case above, notice that we have accidentally removed the blog's most popular article (<www.lawfareblog.com/snowden-revelations>).
The blog editors believed that Snowden's revelations about NSA spying are so important that they directly put a link to the article on the menu.
So every single webpage in the domain links to the Snowden article,
and our "anti-spam" `--filter-ratio` argument removed this article from the list.
In general, it is a challenging open problem to remove spam from pagerank results,
and all current solutions rely on careful human tuning and still have lots of false positives and false negatives.

**Part 4:**

Recall from the reading that the runtime of pagerank depends heavily on the eigengap of the `\bar\bar P` matrix,
and that this eigengap is bounded by the alpha parameter.

Run the following four commands:
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose 
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --alpha=0.99999
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --filter_ratio=0.2
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --filter_ratio=0.2 --alpha=0.99999
```
You should notice that the last command takes considerably more iterations to compute the pagerank vector.
(My code takes 685 iterations for this call, and about 10 iterations for all the others.)

This raises the question: Why does the second command (with the `--alpha` option but without the `--filter_ratio`) option not take a long time to run?
The answer is that the `P` graph for <https://www.lawfareblog.com> naturally has a large eigengap and so is fast to compute for all alpha values,
but the modified graph does not have a large eigengap and so requires a small alpha for fast convergence.

Changing the value of alpha also gives us very different pagerank rankings.
For example, 
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --filter_ratio=0.2
INFO:root:rank=0 pagerank=3.4696e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/trump-asks-supreme-court-stay-congressional-subpeona-tax-returns

```

Which of these rankings is better is entirely subjective,
and the only way to know if you have the "best" alpha for your application is to try several variations and see what is best.
If large alphas are good for your application, you can see that there is a trade-off between quality answers and algorithmic runtime.
We'll be exploring this trade-off more formally in class over the rest of the semester.

## Task 2: the personalization vector

The most interesting applications of pagerank involve the personalization vector.
Implement the `WebGraph.make_personalization_vector` function so that it outputs a personalization vector tuned for the input query.
The pseudocode for the function is:
```
for each index in the personalization vector:
    get the url for the index (see the _index_to_url function)
    check if the url satisfies the input query (see the url_satisfies_query function)
    if so, set the corresponding index to one
normalize the vector
```

**Part 1:**

The command line argument `--personalization_vector_query` will use the function you created above to augment your search with a custom personalization vector.
If you've implemented the function correctly,
you should get results similar to:
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --filter_ratio=0.2 --personalization_vector_query='corona'
INFO:root:rank=0 pagerank=6.3127e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/covid-19-speech-and-surveillance-response
INFO:root:rank=1 pagerank=6.3124e-01 url=www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-live-covid-19-speech-and-surveillance

INFO:root:rank=9 pagerank=7.2888e-02 url=www.lawfareblog.com/house-oversight-committee-holds-day-two-hearing-government-coronavirus-response
```

Notice that these results are significantly different than when using the `--search_query` option:
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --filter_ratio=0.2 --search_query='corona'
INFO:root:rank=0 pagerank=8.1320e-03 url=www.lawfareblog.com/house-oversight-committee-holds-day-two-hearing-government-coronavirus-response

INFO:root:rank=9 pagerank=3.1036e-03 url=www.lawfareblog.com/why-congress-conducting-business-usual-face-coronavirus
```

Which results are better?
Again, that depends on what you mean by "better."
With the `--personalization_vector_query` option,
a webpage is important only if other coronavirus webpages also think it's important;
with the `--search_query` option,
a webpage is important if any other webpage thinks it's important.
You'll notice that in the later example, many of the webpages are about Congressional proceedings related to the coronavirus.
From a strictly coronavirus perspective, these are not very important webpages.
But in the broader context of national security, these are very important webpages.

Google engineers spend TONs of time fine-tuning their pagerank personalization vectors to remove spam webpages.
Exactly how they do this is another one of their secrets that they don't publicly talk about.

**Part 2:**

Another use of the `--personalization_vector_query` option is that we can find out what webpages are related to the coronavirus but don't directly mention the coronavirus.
This can be used to map out what types of topics are similar to the coronavirus.

For example, the following query ranks all webpages by their `corona` importance,
but removes webpages mentioning `corona` from the results.
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=data/lawfareblog.csv.gz --filter_ratio=0.2 --personalization_vector_query='corona' --search_query='-corona'

INFO:root:rank=9 pagerank=5.1245e-02 url=www.lawfareblog.com/livestream-house-armed-services-holds-hearing-national-security-challenges-north-and-south-america
```
You can see that there are many urls about concepts that are obviously related like "covid", "clinical trials", and "quarantine",
but this algorithm also finds articles about Chinese propaganda and Trump's policy decisions.
Both of these articles are highly relevant to coronavirus discussions,
but a simple keyword search for corona or related terms would not find these articles.

<!--
**Part 3:**

Select another topic related to national security.
You should experiment with a national security topic other than the coronavirus.
For example, find out what articles are important to the `iran` topic but do not contain the word `iran`.
Your goal should be to discover what topics that www.lawfareblog.com considers to be related to the national security topic you choose.

1. Ensure that all your changes to the `pagerank.py` and `README.md` files are committed to your repo and pushed to github.

1. Get at least 5 stars on your repo.
   (You made trade stars with other students in the class.)

   > **NOTE:**
   > 
   > Recruiters use github profiles to determine who to hire,
   > and pagerank is used to rank user profiles and projects.
   > Links in this graph correspond to who has starred/followed who's repo.
   > By getting more stars on your repo, you'll be increasing your github pagerank, which increases the likelihood that recruiters will hire you.
   > To see an example, [perform a search for `data mining`](https://github.com/search?q=data+mining).
   > Notice that the results are returned "approximately" ranked by the number of stars,
   > but because "some stars count more than others" the results are not exactly ranked by the number of stars.
   > (I asked you not to fork this repo because forks are ranked lower than non-forks.)
   >
   > In some sense, we are doing a "dual problem" to data mining by getting these stars.
   > Recruiters are using data mining to find out who the best people to recruit are,
   > and we are hacking their data mining algorithms by making those algorithms select you instead of someone else.
   >
   > If you're interested in exploring this idea further, here's a python tutorial for extracting GitHub's social graph: <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mining-the-social/9781449368180/ch07.html> ; if you're interested in learning more about how recruiters use github profiles, read this Hacker News post: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19413348>.

1. Submit the url of your repo to sakai.

   Each part is worth 2 points, for 12 points overall.
